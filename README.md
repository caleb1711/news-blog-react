## Getting Started



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
## Usage of Reusable React Components

### Header Component

The `<Header />` component is used to display the header of our blogging platform. It includes the logo, navigation menu, and user account options.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <div className="container-fluid p-0">
      <div className="main_header dashboard_header">
        <nav className="navbar navbar-expand-lg  custom-header">
          <div className="main_header_text">
            <Link to="/" style={{ textDecoration: "none" }}>
              <h4>
                Ne<span style={{ color: "#ea2d00" }}>w</span>s
              </h4>
              <p>Blog</p>
            </Link>
          </div>
          <button
            className="navbar-toggler navbar_toggler"
            type="button"
            data-bs-toggle="collapse"
            data-bs-target="#navbarSupportedContent"
            aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent"
            aria-expanded="false"
            aria-label="Toggle navigation"
          >
            <span className="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
          </button>
          <div className="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
            <ul className="navbar-nav navbar_nav">
              <li className="nav-item">
                <Link to="/" className="nav-link">

                    </button>
                  </li>
                </>
              ) : (
                <div className="d-flex gap-3">
                  <li className="nav-item">

### Understanding React Architecture

##### Our project follows the component-based architecture of React, which encourages the building of UIs as a collection of reusable components. Here's a brief overview of the architecture:
- Components: React applications are built  using components, which are independent and reusable pieces of UI. Components can be composed together to build complex UIs.

- State and Props: React components can have state and props. State represents the internal state of a component, while props are used to pass data from parent to child components.

- Lifecycle Methods: React components have lifecycle methods that allow developers to hook into various stages of a component's lifecycle, such as mounting, updating, and unmounting.

- Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI. When the state of a component changes, React updates the virtual DOM, compares it with the previous state, and only applies the necessary changes to the real DOM.
