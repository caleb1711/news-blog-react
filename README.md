# Deployment of News Blog React

This guide outlines the steps required to deploy the News Blog React application to Heroku, a cloud platform as a service that supports various programming languages and frameworks.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the deployment, make sure you have the following:

- An existing News Blog React application with a `package.json` file.
- A Heroku account. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://signup.heroku.com/).

## Step 1: Install Heroku CLI

If you haven't already installed the Heroku CLI, follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install) to install it on your local machine.

## Step 2: Prepare Your News Blog App

Ensure that your News Blog React app is ready for deployment. This includes:

- Removing any hardcoded URLs or environment-specific configurations.
- Ensuring that all dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file.

## Step 3: Create a Heroku App

1. Log in to your Heroku account using the Heroku CLI:

    ```bash
    heroku login
    ```

2. Navigate to your News Blog React app's root directory in the terminal.

3. Create a new Heroku app by running the following command:

    ```bash
    heroku create news-blog-react
    ```



## Step 4: Configure Buildpacks

Heroku needs to know how to build your News Blog React app. You'll need to specify buildpacks for both Node.js and the React app.

    ```bash
    heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku/nodejs
    heroku buildpacks:add --index 2 https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git
    ```

## Step 5: Deploy Your App

Deploy your News Blog React app to Heroku using Git:

    ```bash
    git push heroku main
    ```

## Step 6: Open Your App

Once the deployment process is complete, you can open your News Blog app in the browser using the following command:

    ```bash
    heroku open
    ```


## Conclusion

Your News Blog React app is now deployed on Heroku. Now you


## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.


### Understanding React Architecture

##### Our project follows the component-based architecture of React, which encourages the building of UIs as a collection of reusable components. Here's a brief overview of the architecture:
- Components: React applications are built  using components, which are independent and reusable pieces of UI. Components can be composed together to build complex UIs.

- State and Props: React components can have state and props. State represents the internal state of a component, while props are used to pass data from parent to child components.

- Lifecycle Methods: React components have lifecycle methods that allow developers to hook into various stages of a component's lifecycle, such as mounting, updating, and unmounting.

- Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI. When the state of a component changes, React updates the virtual DOM, compares it with the previous state, and only applies the necessary changes to the real DOM.
